# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction - End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a subscription-based business using Machine Learning. The objective is to identify customers who are likely to stop using the service, so the business can take proactive retention actions.

This is an **end-to-end data science solution** that includes:
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis & visualization
- Model training, evaluation & tuning
- Model deployment (Web App API using Flask / Streamlit)
- Business insights & recommendations
